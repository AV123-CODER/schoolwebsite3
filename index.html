<p>Today, Something unexpected happened in my life, Actually It was like a surprise for me, I was completely shocked when I got to know that I’
  ve won the first prize in my Inter School debate on environmental pollution. It was the second time when I participated in debate competition. 
  At the time when I participated for the very first time so I didn’t secure any position in this competition, 
  At that time I felt a little sad but I decided that I’d do more hard work and I will participate again and I guess that I took the right decision
   to participate again, Also I learnt that hard work always pays off because At my first participation,
    I was not concerned towards this competition but when I faced failure then It inspired me to do more hard work and because of that I have gotten
     this prize, My parents are very proud of me and they have gifted me a cycle for my achievement and now I have known that hard work is 
     most important to achieve success.</p>
